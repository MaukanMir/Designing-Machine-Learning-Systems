    "### We first need to consider the objectives of the proposed ML projects. When working on an ML project, data scientists tend to care about the ML objectives: the metrics they can measure about the performance of their ML models such as accuracy, F1 score, inference latency, etc. They get excited about improving their model’s accuracy from 94% to 94.2% and might spend a ton of resources—data, compute, and engineering time—to achieve that.\n",

    "### But the truth is: most companies don’t care about the fancy ML metrics. They don’t care about increasing a model’s accuracy from 94% to 94.2% unless it moves some business metrics. A pattern I see in many short-lived ML projects is that the data scientists become too focused on hacking ML metrics without paying attention to business metrics. Their managers, however, only care about business metrics and, after failing to see how an ML project can help push their business metrics, kill the projects prematurely (and possibly let go of the data science team involved"

    "### Many companies create their own metrics to map business metrics to ML metrics. For example, Netflix measures the performance of their recommender system using take-rate: the number of quality plays divided by the number of recommendations a user sees.4 The higher the take-rate, the better the recommender system. Netflix also put a recommender system’s take-rate in the context of their other business metrics like total streaming hours and subscription cancellation rate. They found that a higher take-rate also results in higher total streaming hours and lower subscription cancellation rates.5"
