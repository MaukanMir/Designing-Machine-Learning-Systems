    "### Then there’s the wonderfully weird world of third-party data. First-party data is the data that your company already collects about your users or customers. Second-party data is the data collected by another company on their own customers that they make available to you, though you’ll probably have to pay for it. Third-party data companies collect data on the public who aren’t their direct customers."

    "### The process of converting a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored or transmitted and reconstructed later is data serialization. There are many, many data serialization formats. When considering a format to work with, you might want to consider different characteristics such as human readability, access patterns, and whether it’s based on text or binary, which influences the size of its files."

    "## Row-Major Versus Column-Major Format\n",
    "\n",
    "### The two formats that are common and represent two distinct paradigms are CSV and Parquet. CSV (comma-separated values) is row-major, which means consecutive elements in a row are stored next to each other in memory. Parquet is column-major, which means consecutive elements in a column are stored next to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Because modern computers process sequential data more efficiently than nonsequential data, if a table is row-major, accessing its rows will be faster than accessing its columns in expectation. This means that for row-major formats, accessing data by rows is expected to be faster than accessing data by columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imagine we have a dataset of 1,000 examples, and each example has 10 features. If we consider each example as a row and each feature as a column, as is often the case in ML, then the row-major formats like CSV are better for accessing examples, e.g., accessing all the examples collected today. Column-major formats like Parquet are better for accessing features, e.g., accessing the timestamps of all your examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Column-major formats allow flexible column-based reads, especially if your data is large with thousands, if not millions, of features. Consider if you have data about ride-sharing transactions that has 1,000 features but you only want 4 features: time, location, distance, price. With column-major formats, you can read the four columns corresponding to these four features directly. However, with row-major formats, if you don’t know the sizes of the rows, you will have to read in all columns then filter down to these four columns. Even if you know the sizes of the rows, it can still be slow as you’ll have to jump around the memory, unable to take advantage of caching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Row-major formats allow faster data writes. Consider the situation when you have to keep adding new individual examples to your data. For each individual example, it’d be much faster to write it to a file where your data is already in a row-major format.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overall, row-major formats are better when you have to do a lot of writes, whereas column-major ones are better when you have to do a lot of column-based reads.\n"
