    "### Convenience sampling\n",
    "* Samples of data are selected based on their availability. This sampling method is popular because, well, it’s convenient.\n",
    "### Snowball sampling\n",
    "* Future samples are selected based on existing samples. For example, to scrape legitimate Twitter accounts without having access to Twitter databases, you start with a small number of accounts, then you scrape all the accounts they follow, and so on.\n",
    "### Judgment sampling\n",
    "* Experts decide what samples to include.\n",
    "### Quota sampling\n",
    "* You select samples based on quotas for certain slices of data without any randomization. For example, when doing a survey, you might want 100 responses from each of the age groups: under 30 years old, between 30 and 60 years old, and above 60 years old, regardless of the actual age distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The samples selected by nonprobability criteria are not representative of the real-world data and therefore are riddled with selection biases.2 Because of these biases, you might think that it’s a bad idea to select data to train ML models using this family of sampling methods. You’re right. Unfortunately, in many cases, the selection of data for ML models is still driven by convenience.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another example is data for sentiment analysis of general text. Much of this data is collected from sources with natural labels (ratings) such as IMDB reviews and Amazon reviews. These datasets are then used for other sentiment analysis tasks. IMDB reviews and Amazon reviews are biased toward users who are willing to leave reviews online, and not necessarily representative of people who don’t have access to the internet or people who aren’t willing to put reviews online.\n",
