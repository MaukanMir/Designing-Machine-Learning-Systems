    "### Stateful training allows you to update your model with less data. Training a model from scratch tends to require a lot more data than fine-tuning the same model. For example, if you retrain your model from scratch, you might need to use all data from the last three months. However, if you fine-tune your model from yesterday’s checkpoint, you only need to use data from the last day."

    "### One beautiful property that is often overlooked is that with stateful training, it might be possible to avoid storing data altogether. In the traditional stateless retraining, a data sample might be reused during multiple training iterations of a model, which means that data needs to be stored. This isn’t always possible, especially for data with strict privacy requirements. In the stateful training paradigm, each model update is trained using only the fresh data, so a data sample is used only once for training, as shown in Figure 9-2. This means that it’s possible to train your model without having to store data in permanent storage, which helps eliminate many concerns about data privacy. However, this is overlooked because today’s let’s-keep-track-of-everything practice still makes many companies reluctant to throw away data"
