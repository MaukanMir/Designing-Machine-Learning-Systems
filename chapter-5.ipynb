Upon investigation it may turn out that the income of respondents who failed to report tends to be higher than that of those who did disclose. The income values are missing for reasons related to the values themselves.\n",

In this example, we might notice that age values are often missing for respondents of the gender “A,” which might be because the people of gender A in this survey don’t like disclosing their age.\n",

    "### This is when there’s no pattern in when the value is missing. In this example, we might think that the missing values for the column “Job” might be completely random, not because of the job itself and not because of any other variable. People just forget to fill in that value sometimes for no particular reason. However, this type of missing is very rare. There are usually reasons why certain values are missing, and you should investigate.\n"
