    "### This is when the reason a value is missing is because of the true value itself. In this example, we might notice that some respondents didn’t disclose their income. Upon investigation it may turn out that the income of respondents who failed to report tends to be higher than that of those who did disclose. The income values are missing for reasons related to the values themselves.\n",

    "### This is when the reason a value is missing is not due to the value itself, but due to another observed variable. In this example, we might notice that age values are often missing for respondents of the gender “A,” which might be because the people of gender A in this survey don’t like disclosing their age.\n",

    "### This is when there’s no pattern in when the value is missing. In this example, we might think that the missing values for the column “Job” might be completely random, not because of the job itself and not because of any other variable. People just forget to fill in that value sometimes for no particular reason. However, this type of missing is very rare. There are usually reasons why certain values are missing, and you should investigate.\n"

    "### When I ask candidates about how to handle missing values during interviews, many tend to prefer deletion, not because it’s a better method, but because it’s easier to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One way to delete is column deletion: if a variable has too many missing values, just remove that variable. For example, in the example above, over 50% of the values for the variable “Marital status” are missing, so you might be tempted to remove this variable from your model. The drawback of this approach is that you might remove important information and reduce the accuracy of your model. Marital status might be highly correlated to buying houses, as married couples are much more likely to be homeowners than single people.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another way to delete is row deletion: if a sample has missing value(s), just remove that sample. This method can work when the missing values are completely at random (MCAR) and the number of examples with missing values is small, such as less than 0.1%. You don’t want to do row deletion if that means 10% of your data samples are removed."
