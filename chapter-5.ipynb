    "* Missing not at random (MNAR)\n",
    "### This is when the reason a value is missing is because of the true value itself. In this example, we might notice that some respondents didn’t disclose their income. Upon investigation it may turn out that the income of respondents who failed to report tends to be higher than that of those who did disclose. The income values are missing for reasons related to the values themselves.\n",

    "### This is when the reason a value is missing is not due to the value itself, but due to another observed variable. In this example, we might notice that age values are often missing for respondents of the gender “A,” which might be because the people of gender A in this survey don’t like disclosing their age.\n",

    "* Missing completely at random (MCAR)\n",
    "### This is when there’s no pattern in when the value is missing. In this example, we might think that the missing values for the column “Job” might be completely random, not because of the job itself and not because of any other variable. People just forget to fill in that value sometimes for no particular reason. However, this type of missing is very rare. There are usually reasons why certain values are missing, and you should investigate.\n"

    "## Deletion\n",
    "\n",
    "### When I ask candidates about how to handle missing values during interviews, many tend to prefer deletion, not because it’s a better method, but because it’s easier to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One way to delete is column deletion: if a variable has too many missing values, just remove that variable. For example, in the example above, over 50% of the values for the variable “Marital status” are missing, so you might be tempted to remove this variable from your model. The drawback of this approach is that you might remove important information and reduce the accuracy of your model. Marital status might be highly correlated to buying houses, as married couples are much more likely to be homeowners than single people.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Another way to delete is row deletion: if a sample has missing value(s), just remove that sample. This method can work when the missing values are completely at random (MCAR) and the number of examples with missing values is small, such as less than 0.1%. You don’t want to do row deletion if that means 10% of your data samples are removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### However, removing rows of data can also remove important information that your model needs to make predictions, especially if the missing values are not at random (MNAR). For example, you don’t want to remove samples of gender B respondents with missing income because the fact that income is missing is information itself (missing income might mean higher income, and thus, more correlated to buying a house) and can be used to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### On top of that, removing rows of data can create biases in your model, especially if the missing values are at random (MAR). For example, if you remove all examples missing age values in the data in Table 5-2, you will remove all respondents with gender A from your data, and your model won’t be able to make good predictions for respondents with gender A."

    "## Imputation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Even though deletion is tempting because it’s easy to do, deleting data can lead to losing important information and introduce biases into your model. If you don’t want to delete missing values, you will have to impute them, which means “fill them with certain values.” Deciding which “certain values” to use is the hard part.\n",
    "\n",
    "### One common practice is to fill in missing values with their defaults. For example, if the job is missing, you might fill it with an empty string “”. Another common practice is to fill in missing values with the mean, median, or mode (the most common value). For example, if the temperature value is missing for a data sample whose month value is July, it’s not a bad idea to fill it with the median temperature of July.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Both practices work well in many cases, but sometimes they can cause hair-pulling bugs. One time, in one of the projects I was helping with, we discovered that the model was spitting out garbage because the app’s frontend no longer asked users to enter their age, so age values were missing, and the model filled them with 0. But the model never saw the age value of 0 during training, so it couldn’t make reasonable predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multiple techniques might be used at the same time or in sequence to handle missing values for a particular set of data. Regardless of what techniques you use, one thing is certain: there is no perfect way to handle missing values. With deletion, you risk losing important information or accentuating biases. With imputation, you risk injecting your own bias into and adding noise to your data, or worse, data leakage. If you don’t know what data leakage is, don’t panic, we’ll cover it in the section"
